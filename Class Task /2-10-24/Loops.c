	Increment and decremnent operators 
	increment operators are of two types - 
	1. Post increment operators (i++)  it means print and then increase which means if i = 1 the first print will be 1 and next will be 2 and so on. 
	2. Pre increment operators (++i)  it means increase and then print which means if i = 1 the first print will be 2 and next will be 3 and so on.
	
	decrement operators are of 2 types - 
	1. Post decrement operators (i--) it means print and then decrease which means if i = 1 the first print will be 1 and then will be 0 and so on. 
	2. Pre decrement operators (--i) it means decrease and then print which means if i = 1 the first print will be 0 and then -1 and so on.
